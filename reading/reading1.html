        The third characteristic pleasure of digital environments is the pleasure of transformation. Computers offer us countless ways of shape-shifting. Using “morphing” software, we can transform faces so seamlessly that a grinning teenage boy melts into a haggard old woman, as if under a magic spell. Putting on a virtual reality helmet, we earthbound interactors find ourselves transmuted into soaring crows. The computer captures processes, and it therefore is always suggesting processes to us even when it is just displaying information. Anything we see in digital format—words, numbers, images, moving pictures—becomes more plastic, more inviting of change. The transformative power of the computer is particularly seductive in narrative environments. It makes us eager for masquerade, eager to pick up the joystick and become a cowboy or a space fighter, eager to log on to the MUD and become ElfGirl or BlackDagger. Because digital objects can have multiple instantiations, they call forth our delight in variety itself. The digital Barbie doll has fifteen hundred possible outfits. A fight in Mortal Kombat can be between any two of sixteen distinct opponents, with the interactor taking either side of any combat. MUDs compete with one another over the variety of roles they support (elves, hobbits, Magi, thieves, enchanted animals, etc., each category having its own possible powers and abilities). In computer games we do not settle for one life, or even for one civilization; when things go wrong or when we just want a different version of the same experience, we go back for a replay.
As the medium matures, this same love of variation can be exploited for more subtle effects. Borges anticipated the pleasures of a multivariant world when he offered this glimpse of two parallel scenes in the labyrinthine novel imagined in “Forking Paths”: 

In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.

The juxtaposition of these two different experiences of the same winning battle reminds the reader that life itself is simultaneously desolate and splendid. By varying the texture of their experience in this way, Borges makes the doubly winning soldiers seem all the more vulnerable. But such constant shape-shifting is also disconcerting. How can a writer tell a connected story in so fluid an environment? How will the interactor know when it begins and ends? Just as we need to define new narrative conventions for entering the immersive world and for exercising agency within it, so too do we need a new set of formal conventions for handling mutability. These conventions will arise we get a clearer understanding of what kinds of pleasures we will seek from a literature of transformation. Kaleidoscopic Narrative One way to understand the new narrative environment is through the metaphor of the kaleidoscope. As Marshall McLuhan pointed out, the communications media of the twentieth century are mosaic rather than linear in structure, as compared to the printed book. Newspapers are made up of many stories calling for our attention on a single page, films are mosaics of individual shots, and television is even more mosaic in the age of the remote control than it was when McLuhan wrote about it. These mosaic informational formats have created mosaic patterns of thought that we now take for granted. We are now used to viewing the front page of a newspaper without being overwhelmed, because we have learned to take in multiple kinds of information in one quick snapshot. Similarly, years of viewing films have allowed us to automatically assemble their discontinuous images into larger patterns of continuity. We can do this because we know how to read the conventions of these media. We are guided by headline size and story placement to find our way among the many different kinds of stories in the newspaper. We know how to construct continuous space in a film by matching an exterior shot with an interior shot, and we know that a change in lighting or focus signals a flashback or a subjective memory. Mosaic organization is valuable because it gives us the overview of the front page and the faster narrative pace of the movie. We also savor the juxtapositions that these mosaic forms make possible: the shots of the Mafia godfather at the baptism intercut with shots of the murders he has ordered, the liberal op-ed column side by side with the conservative op-ed column, the cheery 1950s sitcom one click of the remote away from the lurid 1990s talk show. The computer presents us with the spatial mosaic of the newspaper page, the temporal mosaic of film, and the participatory mosaic of TV remote control. But even while it combines the confusing multiplicity of these mosaic media, the computer offers us new ways of mastering fragmentation. It gives us “search engines” and ways to “tag” the fragments so that we can find things that are related to one another. It can preserve the history of our particular path through a web so that we can retrace it. It can generate Web pages on the fly that display exactly the kinds of things we want we to see. It offers us a multidimensional kaleidoscope with which to rearrange the fragments over and over again, and it allows us to shift back and forth between alternate patterns of mosaic organization. This kaleidoscopic structure has many possibilities for narrative, but one of the most compelling is the ability to present simultaneous actions in multiple ways. In a novel, simultaneous actions are presented consecutively. Whether we are taken to opposing camps on a battlefield or into different minds around a dining table, the simultaneous events are often described in overlapping rather than in completely parallel time segments; the action of the story keeps moving forward as our point of view shifts. In a film or TV show, we can cut back and forth between several simultaneous events during a brief sequence (as in the baptism-murder sequence in The Godfather) or between two or three narrative threads over a longer time period (as in different patient crises in various parts of the hospital on ER), but the longer the segments, the more likely it is that the time of the story is advancing with each scene rather than being retraced in different locales. On the computer we can lay out all the simultaneous actions in one grid and then allow the interactor to navigate among them. We can have the expansiveness of the novel with the rapid intercutting of the film. How do we do this without overwhelming the interactor? We will need a coherent set of conventions for signalling interactors when they can move from one simultaneous action to another and for helping them keep track of where and when the various actions are taking place. We can start by building upon the theatrical conventions of exits and entrances, but in a digital story the stage of the narrative may have multiple sets, that is, many separate places that are within the scope of the dramatic action. Whenever characters move among these sets, the reader/interactor should be able to follow them, in just the way a camera might follow an actor from room to room. The story line of such a multistage narrative will have to be structured in such a way that it arouses readers’ curiosity, enticing them from one set to the next. There have already been a few live theatrical presentations that have moved toward such a dramatic structure. One concrete model for such a story is the comical trilogy by Alan Ayckbourn, collectively called The Norman Conquests, which was originally performed in London and New York on three successive nights.1 The trilogy revolves around three couples: Annie, an unmarried woman who is taking care of her cranky bedridden mother, and her overly shy suitor, Tom, a veterinarian; Ruth, Annie’s businesslike sister, and her womanizing husband, Norman; and Reg, brother to Annie and Ruth, and his overcontrolling wife, Sarah. The farcical action takes place in Annie’s house and involves Norman’s flirtation with both Annie and Sarah while trying to placate his wife, Ruth; Tom’s slow movement toward courtship with Annie; and everyone’s quarrels with everyone else. This inventive romantic farce is made more intriguing by its unique spatial organization: all three plays cover the same time period and involve the same characters, but each one covers the events in a different part of the house (the dining room, the living room, or the garden). An exit in one play is an entrance in one of the others. The acts of the plays are carefully labeled with the date and time, and the action is exquisitely coordinated so that all three can be assembled (in the viewer’s mind) into a single multistage dramatic presentation. Even though each of the plays makes sense in itself, the actors’ frequent exits and entrances arouse our curiosity about what has been going on in the other spaces. For example, the actors enter laughing or express horror at something that has happened in the next room. This is a dramatic structure that cries out for a navigating viewer, but it also suggests the difficulty of telling a story with simultaneous actions. Part of the charm of each play comes from not letting the viewer know things, from showing us effects before we see the causes. At breakfast in the dining room (Play No. 1), everyone is furious with Norman for something he has done the previous night in the living room (Play No. 2). If we had been permitted to follow the characters into the living room, the breakfast scene would lose some of its tension for us. Furthermore, there are times in each of the plays when a character is alone in the space and has to do some bit of stage business to pass the time before the next actor’s entrance. A little of that goes a long way. A digital playwright would have to be even more clever than the extremely clever Ayckbourn in order to arrange the dramatic action with such precision that it could sustain suspense over multiple pathways. A narrative world with such extraordinary spatial depth and temporal continuity is more immersive, more reinforcing of our belief, than a conventional play. However, we will have to develop clear conventions for navigating it. Do we allow movement backward as well as forward in time? Do we allow movement across the same moment of time? Since these will be artistic choices dictated by the story material, there will not be a single answer, but every narrative will have to signal the reader very carefully about what is allowed in order not to raise inappropriate expectations. The kaleidoscopic stories written by students in my interactive narrative course offer some interesting approaches to this question. In one the reader is placed in a restaurant, and the waiters serve as the means of moving the reader from one group of characters to another. Since no one goes out the door in the course of the story, the fictional world has clear boundaries and does not raise any expectations it cannot meet. In another story, the reader is on a bus that moves forward in screens of text that wipe from right to left across the screen. People get on and off the bus, and the reader can enter their thoughts (including their observations of one another), which form the action of the story. The story offers readers a chance to do something that most bus riders fantasize about: find out who that odd person across the aisle actually is. It enhances its readers’ curiosity by not allowing any backward movement. They must follow the bus forward in time, but at each stop they can change their point of view if they wish. In order to find out the whole story, they have to take the trip again, making different choices.2 A third student story works like a multidimensional Robert Altman film, focusing on intersecting stories all happening in Manhattan on the same day. A bus driver is having trouble with his eyes, a limo driver is picking up a movie star, a high school couple is going climbing, a young girl is going out with her young aunt. At the points where these stories converge—the bus and the limo are in an accident, the teenagers see the little girl throw up on the subway—the reader can move into the other narrative, much in the way that a movie might use a curious glance from one character to cut into the story of another. Since all the characters are moving around, their stories can be represented on a map of New York, with each scene in the narrative tied to a specific place. The image of the intersecting lines—something like a subway map—tells readers where they are and what they can choose to see.3 As the art of digital storytelling develops, authors will gain more skill in fulfilling the possibilities for interesting juxtapositions. Film is an important model for this technique. In the 1920s the Russian film pioneer Lev Kuleshov demonstrated that audiences will take the same footage of an actor’s face as signifying appetite, grief, or affection, depending on whether it is juxtaposed with images of a bowl of soup, a dead woman, or a little girl playing with a teddy bear. Using the computer, we can make use of the Kuleshov effect to create juxtapositions that are intentionally open to multiple meaningful interpretations. In a kaleidoscopic story with multiple points of view, any shared event can take on different meanings, depending on whether the same moment is approached in the context of one character’s life or another’s. The discovery of an infidelity, for instance, might be represented by a neutrally dramatized scene—perhaps a wife reaching for the playback button on an answering machine in the presence of her guilty husband—that would gain in narrative significance when reached from different paths. One sequence might involve the comic recklessness of the husband; another the narcissistic self-absorption of the wife; a third the future devastation of the child, observing this pivotal moment unseen from the doorway. Told in this way, the story would be about the intersecting emotional planes of family experience. By experiencing such interwoven stories as one unit, we can enhance the kaleidoscopic capacity of our minds, our capacity to imagine life from multiple points of view. One moment in a student story particularly illuminates for me the potential of the medium for capturing delicate dramatic moments with new immediacy. In Rachel Molenaar’s “Evening,” which takes place in a small apartment, the reader is able to move into the minds of a working mother, her son and daughter, and their pet cat and dog as they go through their nightly routine a few months after the death of the father of the family. At one point they are all relaxing together in front of the TV, parent and children sharing a fragile communion after a tense meal. The mother, increasingly refreshed as the sitcom continues, has a rush of sympathy for her daughter, with whom she had been quarreling earlier in the evening; she silently moves the dozing cat from her own lap to her daughter’s. We see this tiny moment of connectedness from three points of view: the mother’s, the daughter’s, and the cat’s. This is an intimate moment that might be presented in linear fiction, as a domestic stream-of-consciousness narrative in the style of Virginia Woolf. It could also be done as a telling dramatic gesture on the stage or on film. But in digital form it takes on a different power. The act of navigating from one consciousness to the other reinforces the separateness of the three fragile creatures and reenacts the gesture of connection. We are in the apartment with them; we see them with the exterior clarity of a film and the inferiority of a novel. Such an expressive moment marks the emergence of a new narrative convention, which we might call a panoramic close-up (building on film techniques) or a composite epiphany (building on short-story aesthetics). By rotating our point of view at a single moment of dramatic illumination, we capture both the shared reality and the separate experiences that compose it. The kaleidoscopic power of the computer allows us to tell stories that more truly reflect our turn-of-the-century sensibility. We no longer believe in a single reality, a single integrating view of the world, or even the reliability of a single angle of perception. Yet we retain the core human desire to fix reality on one canvas, to express all of what we see in an integrated and shapely manner. The solution is the kaleidoscopic canvas that can capture the world as it looks from many perspectives—complex and perhaps ultimately unknowable but still coherent. Morphing Story Environments Another kind of narrative experience that takes advantage of the shape-shifting digital medium is one in which interactors are invited to enact or construct their own stories out of a set of formulaic elements. We can think of such an environment as not so much a story as a narrative world that is capable of supporting many possible stories. Brenda Laurel has suggested that virtual reality is not for passive entertainment but for active free-form play and that adults are capable of such play if their imaginations have been “booted up” by an environment with rich narrative possibilities. In chapters 7 and 8 we will look at some of the computational and literary techniques that might allow us to build such environments. For now, let us assume that we have a kind of animated doll’s house with characters who are as interesting to adults as the characters on the TV series NYPD Blue or ER or One Life to Live. Suppose we could enter such an environment not merely as players in a MUD but as a god in control of assembling all the characters. Suppose we could set the story of our choice in motion and then observe or participate in it, slipping in and out of whichever roles appealed to us. What would such narrative play be like? Where would it lead to? Virtual Reality in Haworth Parsonage It is only the relatively few adults who are gifted storytellers who can spend many waking hours a day in imaginary worlds of their own creation. Perhaps the best-documented example of prolonged imaginative play beyond early childhood is the Brontë family. Left motherless when they were under five and then deprived of their motherly older sisters, who both died of consumption a few years later, the four surviving Brontë children (Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, and Anne) amused and sustained themselves by making up stories. They started with a box of wooden soldiers, which they divided up, named, and imagined in an African city they called Verdopolis. They played with the soldiers in the usual way of children, and they made believe that they were the characters. Soon they started writing a newspaper and a chronicle of Verdopolis.4 Because their older sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, took sick at school, the Brontë children imagined nightmare schools where children were tortured. When Charlotte was thirteen she wrote down one such precocious gothic fantasy: In the hall of the fountain, behind a statue, is a small door over which is drawn a curtain of white silk. This door when opened discovers a small apartment, at the farther end of which is a very large iron door to a long passage. At the end is a flight of steps leading to a subterranean dungeon, a wide vault dimly lighted by a lamp which casts a death-like melancholy luster over a part of the dungeon, leaving the rest in the gloomy darkness of midnight. In the middle is a slab of black marble supported by four pillars. At the end of it stands a throne of iron. In several parts of the vault are instruments of torture. At the end of this dungeon are the cells which are appropriated to the private and particular use of naughty children. These cells are darkly vaulted and so far down in the earth that the loudest shriek could not be heard by an inhabitant of the upper world. In these, as well as in the dungeon, the most unjust torturing might go on without any fear of detection, if it were not that I keep the key of the dungeon and Emily keeps the key of the cells and of the huge iron entrance which will brave any assault except with lawful instrument.5 The Brontë children invented their own Zork, a dungeon world to which they held the key. They were not merely adventurers in this macabre world, they were the dungeon masters in control of the instruments of torture and death, masters of the graveyard. The documentation of such a world, the explicitness of its physical dimensions, is reassuring in the same way the solving of a dungeon maze is reassuring. But unlike Zork, Verdopolis was not a single-use toy. It was an open-ended fantasy that changed as the children’s emotional needs changed. When Charlotte went off to school at age fifteen, the game was rearranged to suit the siblings’ new obsessions. Emily and Anne, the younger children, rebelliously seceded and invented their own fantasy kingdom of Gondal, ruled by an imperious queen with whom Emily was closely identified. Charlotte and Branwell continued to collaborate on variations of the original story, variations in which Branwell invented a civil war between the main Verdopolis (now Glass-Town) hero, Arthur Wellesley (now Zamorna, King of Angria), and his foil, an ex-pirate and rebel named Percy, Earl of Northangerland, with whom Branwell identified very strongly. Charlotte, for whom going off to school revived memories of the mistreatment and patient suffering of her sister Maria, invented docile and doomed wives for Zamorna whose names echo her idealized sister’s. Marian Hume and Mary Henrietta Percy are beloved daughters and adoring wives who (like Griselda of medieval legend) sweetly submit to their husbands’ authority, give up their children without a murmur, and die when Zamorna grows tired of them. 
Reading about these Mary figures is like watching a child play with a doll so beautiful that she has to be careful not to wrinkle its clothes. They are avatars operated at a distance, repeating a rigidly limited, frightening story. At this point in the collaborative creative efforts of the Brontë siblings, Branwell was intensely involved with the military strategy of his heroes and their ever-repeating, never-resolved combat, much like a twentieth-century teenager playing videogames, while Charlotte was doing the equivalent of playing with cutout dolls or Barbie dolls, an occupation that has also been transferred into digital form. The difference between the Brontës’ play and these less creative activities is that the Brontës had strong narrative imaginations and could assimilate formulaic patterns and appropriate them to their own use. There is nothing original in the Mary doll figures, but they are intensely Charlotte’s because she constructed them. The exercise of constructive agency on external, formulaic materials invests the character or toy with the power of a threshold object, the power to create the immersive trance. Charlotte was a young adult with a writer’s gift for shaping her make-believe into coherent stories. Her skillful activity is therefore similar to what an unskilled adult might do with a romance novel that is presented not as a paperback but as an electronic construction kit. Having set a predictable pattern in place, Charlotte began to experiment with variations by inventing foils for her passive heroines. Zamorna’s first wife, Marian Hume, has a foil and enemy in Zenobia Ellrington, an accomplished musician and a learned and articulate woman who, as her name indicates, shares with Zamorna an aggressive sexuality.6 In creating this character, Charlotte raised the question of whether another kind of woman might fit into a world where desire is given free rein. But she kept herself very distant from her creation, treating Zenobia as a clear villain and having Zamorna repeatedly humiliate her. After trying out these characters and juxtaposing them, Charlotte created a heroine with whom she could identify more closely—Mina Laury, who becomes Zamorna’s mistress. Like Zenobia, Mina is characterized by her masculine accomplishments: she can run an estate, counsel political ministers, and travel with the hero in wartime. But she manages to be both assertive and loved. She is overtly rivalrous with Mary and is allowed to shine at Mary’s expense, as in this argument between them over who best loves Zamorna: “I would die for him.” [boasts Mina] “You would not,” said [Mary]. “I could not do more and I am confident there is not a woman on earth would do so much for him as I myself!” “Delicate soft-bred, brittle creature,” returned she with kindling eyes, “that is an empty boast. The spirit might carry you far but the body would break down at last … it is not for an indulged daughter of aristocracy … to talk of serving Zamorna. She may please and entertain him and blossom brightly on his smiles, but when adversity saddens him … I warn you, he will call for … one … who knows the feel of a hard bed and the taste of a dry crust, who has been rudely nurtured and not shielded like a hothouse flower from every blast of chilling wind…. With what morbid delicacy would you shrink from scenes that I have looked upon unmoved.”7 Although she was offering to die for Zamorna, Mina’s speech is in fact a declaration of survival. She was saying that it is better to be coarse and passionate and alive (as Charlotte thought of herself) than to be delicate and docile and dead (as she thought of her sister Maria). Mina was a clear step in the direction of the defiant and sturdy Jane Eyre, the woman who ministers to the rough and surly Rochester and copes with fire, stab wounds, and secret midnight errands. As Charlotte matured, she transformed her doll-like heroines into the shape of women she could grow into. Her stories were her way of rehearsing for the emotional hardiness she would need in her adult life. The regressive, violent, overheated emotional universe of the young Brontës is very like the narrative world of many electronic games. Myst, for example, is also the result of a long sibling collaboration (between Rand Miller and Robyn Miller) and has the same Napoleonic echoes, the same bloodthirsty playacting quality, and the same emphasis on betrayal and power struggles as the Brontë juvenilia, though it is set in magical worlds with sentient monkeys and a science fiction veneer. One element that renders both the Brontë juvenilia and the Miller brothers’ fantasies so claustrophobic is the undisguised nature of their wish fulfillment. Myst’s primitive vision of evildoing and rich rewards is appropriate to the current early stage of electronic fiction development. In fact, part of the reason the “winning” ending of Myst is so dull is that it does not partake of this gothic, violent undercurrent that runs through the rest of the game. In order for electronic narrative to reach a higher level of expressiveness, the medium as a whole must make the shift that Charlotte made, that is, away from adolescent rehearsal fantasies and toward the expression of more realistic desires. In Charlotte’s case we have a record of how she made the shift, one that suggests how constructive interactors might use such overheated participatory narratives. Charlotte was the only one of the four Brontë children to end her childhood fantasy life when she reached adulthood. Branwell continued to sign himself Northangerland to the end of his life. Emily and Anne played at their fantasy kingdom until their late twenties (when Charlotte disrupted it so that they could all write for publication). But Charlotte abandoned Zamorna and his world at age twenty-three. She was able to do this because she had taken her Angria fantasy as far as it could go in exploring her feelings of sexual longing and guilt. In one of her last Angrian stories, Caroline Vernon, the deepest level of wish fulfillment within the fantasy comes to the surface in very explicit terms, and the protagonist is as closely identified as possible with the author. Not only is Caroline a variant of Charlotte, but Caroline, like her author, has a “delicious” obsessive daydream of a fantasy lover, “a hero, yet nameless and formless, a mystic being, a dread shadow … [who] haunted her day and night when she had nothing else useful to occupy her head or her hands.” Charlotte is here confronting the absurdity of her own infatuation with the imaginary Zamorna and is allowing herself to look at the boundary between her immersive world and her ordinary life. She is getting ready to leave her make-believe kingdom. In Caroline Vernon the underlying sexual content of the Zamorna/Percy/Mary plot becomes clear: the wish to supplant the mother/sister in the regard of the father/lover. Caroline is the illegitimate child of Percy and is rivalrous with her legitimate sister Mary for their father’s love, as well as for the romantic attention of Zamorna, who is Caroline’s “guardian” and Mary’s husband. Caroline’s mother, the actress Louisa Vernon, is romantically involved with both Percy and Zamorna. The sexual rivalry of mother and daughter and the mother’s antagonism toward the daughter’s sexuality—both classical oedipal configurations—are presented in Caroline Vernon in much more explicit terms than in any of the Brontës’ earlier stories. They are magically resolved in favor of the daughter, as in this scene in which Louisa threatens to tell Percy that Caroline has been flirting with Zamorna:
“I’ll tell you all!” almost screamed her ladyship. “I’ll lay bare the whole vile scheme! your father shall know you, Miss, what you are, and he is. I never mentioned the subject before, but I’ve noticed, and I’ve laid it all up and nobody shall hinder me from proclaiming your baseness aloud.” “Good heaven! this won’t do,” said Caroline, blushing red as fire. “Be silent, Mother. I hardly know what you mean, but you seem to be possessed. Not another word now. Go to bed—do. Come, I’ll help you to your room.” “Don’t fawn; don’t coax,” cried the infuriated little woman. “It’s too late. I’ve made up my mind. Percy, your daughter is a bold, impudent minx; as young as she is, she’s a-----” She could not finish the sentence. Caroline fairly capsized her mother, and took her into her arms and carried her out of the room. She was heard in the passage calling Elise and firmly ordering her to undress her lady and put her to bed. She locked the door of her bedroom and then she came down stairs with the key in her hand.8 The scene has the clarity and absurdity of a dream, a simple fulfillment of an infantile wish to change places with mother, to pick up the “little woman” and put her to bed. Now it is the hostile and punishing mother who is locked up in the dungeon, and the daughter is free to do what she pleases. The story ends with Caroline seduced by Zamorna, and civil war opening all over again between Zamorna and Percy. The story cannot go any further. It has come clear. At this point Charlotte bids farewell to Angria and turns her attention to writing realistic fiction.9 Charlotte’s departure from Angria is one model for achieving closure in a shape-shifting story world. The experience of the underlying fantasy coming to the surface is not merely an exhaustion of narrative possibilities; it is more like the solution to a constructivist puzzle. Projection of highly personal (but universally felt) emotional content onto the figures of the formulaic story moves the content into a field where it is safe to think about it. It is putting your most dangerous fantasies in a dungeon to which you hold the keys. Because the fantasy has been externalized, it can be manipulated. If the external structure is too rigid and too literal (like Branwell’s endless military campaigns or the endless combat of the video arcade), the externalized fantasy can serve as a safety valve but the plot does not progress and the experience does not reach closure. But if the imaginative environment is more plastic and more ambiguously evocative, the fantasy can progress. We can sustain our engagement in such a constructivist world, bring our deepest emotional conundrums into it, and then play them out in multiple ways until they come clear. The experience of closure here may not be in the beauty of the particular story but in the completeness of engagement with the whole range of story possibilities. D. W. Winnicott described a similar process of imaginative “saturation” in children’s play. Children play with a certain toy or play out a certain imaginative experience until it has absorbed all the emotional ambivalence they feel about the subject, and then they are ready to transfer their feelings to the world at large, to what Winnicott called the “whole cultural field.”10 As a society we use television series in much the same way, asking them to present us with situations that are particularly frightening or appealing (crime, emergency rooms, family life, women in the workplace, sexually active single people) and that we have not yet assimilated into our national consciousness. The programs assemble formulaic characters and situations that express our anxieties and desires and then offer variations on the patterns. When every variation of the situation has been played out, as in the final season of a long-running series, the underlying fantasy comes to the surface. Thus, the Miami cop suffers amnesia while doing undercover work and becomes a criminal, the crusty newsroom boss imagines he is actually sleeping with the perky producer, the mismatched couple who have resisted one another finally get together. These episodes are often embarrassing in the same way that Caroline Vernon is embarrassing. Robbed of the elaboration of sublimation, the fantasy is too bald and unrealistic, like the child carrying the mother up to bed. The suppressed fantasy has a tremendous emotional charge, but once its energy has saturated the story pattern, it loses its tension. We can look at it directly, with less anxiety, but we also find it less compelling. Nevertheless, such formulaic stories can also be very insightful and well written before they run out of steam. In fact, their exhaustion can be an indication of the fact that we have assimilated their patterns into our general understanding of the world, that there is no longer a story for us in the core situation, whether it be people dying in a hospital room full of strangers or aggressive women in the work world or frighteningly dysfunctional child rearing. The shifting patterns of the formulaic story have expressed our ambivalent feelings, absorbed our excitement, and made the threatening or alluring situation into something familiar. Enactment as a Transformational Experience As Scheherazade and Jesus both knew, storytelling can be a powerful agent of personal transformation. The right stories can open our hearts and change who we are. Digital narratives add another powerful element to this potential by offering us the opportunity to enact stories rather than to merely witness them. Enacted events have a transformative power that exceeds both narrated and conventionally dramatized events because we assimilate them as personal experiences. The emotional impact of enactment within an immersive environment is so strong that virtual reality installations have been found to be effective for psychotherapy. Psychologists in several research centers are treating phobic patients by exposing them to virtual environments that simulate the situations that trigger their anxiety attacks. The desensitizing process is in essence a participation in a fictional world. Researchers in California and Atlanta have relieved patients’ long-standing fear of heights by having them “walk” over virtual bridges and ride in virtual elevators. Patients initially respond to the virtual environments with terror, just as they would to the real-world experience. The therapist then accompanies them through the experience, helping them practice self-calming behaviors. Essentially, the patients are practicing coping behaviors in the virtual environment; they are like actors at a dress rehearsal. The inner changes brought on by such experiential learning then allow them to apply the same behaviors to the real world. Patients who can ride a virtual glass elevator in a virtual hotel lobby can then go to dinner on the seventy-second floor of the Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta, and patients who cross a virtual Golden Gate Bridge can then cross the real one.11 This virtual reality therapy falls between two other therapeutic techniques: actually accompanying the patient in the real-life frightening situation and talking the patient through an imaginary experience under hypnosis. The virtual world is more external than the hypnotic experience but artificial enough to make it possible for patients to approach it at a much earlier stage than they could if facing the actual situation. It is a threshold environment. Those patients who do not find VR therapy helpful are those who complain that it is either too real or not real enough. The key to the success of the treatment, then, is the establishment of the world as a fictional space. 
These results echo the processes observed in some MUD participants who use their imaginary personas to practice social skills they are trying to cultivate in the “real” (i.e., nonelectronic) world. For instance, one woman recovered her sexual confidence after an amputation by enacting the part of a similarly handicapped character on a MUD.12 As in the case of the phobic patients, the virtual experience worked because it was enough like the real one to raise the same anxieties but safe enough to allow for imaginative rehearsal. The transformational power of enacted narratives holds both promise and danger for the future. On the one hand, it may make digital environments as important as television currently is for the presentation of problem plays, stories about social injustice or intolerance that are meant to broaden the audience’s sympathies. Electronic narratives are already being used to teach such skills as language learning, military medicine, and corporate decision making. They could also be used to teach ways of being in the world, to teach, for example, how to resolve conflicts, how to be a successful job applicant, how to be a nurturing parent, how to be a nonabusive spouse or parent. If these issues are embedded in interactive narrative that is fictionalized just enough to be compelling but not threatening, such narratives might be as effective in changing behavior as an acrophobic’s walk across a virtual bridge. On the other hand, computer enactment may also reinforce violent or antisocial behaviors. Already a college student in the Midwest has been disciplined for publishing on the Internet a rape fantasy in which he names an actual fellow student. We may be moving toward a situation like that depicted in the Star Trek episode, aptly named “Hollow Pursuits,” in which a withdrawn and awkward crew member becomes addicted to holodeck programs that allow him to outfight or seduce the people he is intimidated by in his actual life.13 Just as psychologists are considering scanning in images of their patient’s actual family members for VR therapy, there is no reason why people could not scan their boss’s image into a customized version of Doom and blast away. Would this exercise make it more or less likely that they would actually shoot their boss? Whatever the answer, it is clear that literal wish-fulfillment fantasies would not help a person cope with the actual situation. The difference between immersive environments that are escapist and those that are progressive may lie in the difference between the repetitive stories of Branwell Brontë and the progressive stories of Charlotte Brontë. The more fully constructivist the story environment, the more opportunities it will offer to move beyond the enactment of destructive patterns. The goal of mature fictional environments should not be to exclude antisocial material but to include it in a form in which it can be engaged, remodeled, and worked through. Therefore, an environment in which we can only kill dragons, no matter how many different ways we can transform their appearance, is less desirable than one in which we can also domesticate them, worship them, ally with them against other monsters, or perhaps even take them for a ride in a multistory atrium elevator.

Refused Closure
					
In a shape-shifting world, stories often do not come to a clear end point. Electronic narrative teases us, holding back its gifts. The labyrinth is tricky, full of dead ends, uncertainties, questions that do not resolve. Adventure games demand hundreds of hours of play, of mostly frustrating trial and error, to discover the way forward. Sometimes their secrets must be discovered outside the game, from magazines or by trading information with fellow players or perhaps by finding one’s way over the Internet to the right Web site or newsgroup. In the solutionless rhizome or the solvable maze, we are confronted with a world that lures us in with the promise of treasures but that is chiefly designed to resist our efforts.
					
Perhaps this is a virtue. To be always in search of secret information, in pursuit of refused reward, can be emotionally riveting. Because we are aware that this is a created world, we can experience its resistance to our efforts as a dramatic contest with the programmer or writer over a gift that is purposely withheld. We may experience this withholding presence as a demanding parent, a challenging teacher, a coy lover, or a secretive boss, and be all the more engaged by the contest. Or we may experience it as a sustained arousal, a prolonged lovemaking with the climax always a little out of reach. Because of its ability to both offer and withhold, the computer is a seductive medium in which much of the pleasure lies in the sustained engagement, the refusal of climax.
The question of confused extent and refused closure is explicitly posed by Michael Joyce in his hypertext novel Afternoon, which has no overview of contents and no clearly marked ending. Instead, Joyce tells his readers to decide for themselves when the story is over. In a lexia entitled “work in progress,” he states plainly: “Closure is, in any fiction, a suspect quality, although here it is made manifest. When the story no longer progresses, or when it cycles, or when you tire of the paths, the experience of reading it ends.” This is closure as exhaustion, not as completion. Not satisfied with this formulation, others have described closure in Afternoon in terms akin to the solution to a maze. For example, it is said to be achieved when “having assigned particular sections to particular sequences or reading paths, many, though not all, of which one can retrace at will, one reaches a point at which one’s initial cognitive dissonance or puzzlement disappears, and one seems satisfied. One has reached—or created—closure!”14
In other words, electronic closure occurs when a work’s structure, though not its plot, is understood. This closure involves a cognitive activity at one remove from the usual pleasures of hearing a story. The story itself has not resolved. It is not judged as consistent or satisfying. Instead, the map of the story inside the head of the reader has become clear. Such a map does not necessarily feel inevitable or appropriate, the way the solution to a puzzle does. It may not be beautiful or shapely in any way. There is no emotional release or perception of fittingness, just a sense of going from the unknown to the known. This is very different from and far less pleasurable than our more traditional expectations of closure, as arising from the plot of the story and marking the end point of an action.15
Of course, closure can be feared as well as desired. This is so not only because of disturbing story content, as in Afternoon, but also because it is painful to break the immersive trance, to come up from an enveloping medium into the chilly air of reality. In encyclopedic narratives in particular—a three-decker novel, a television series, a months-long puzzle game—the ending can be painful to the creators and to the
					
audience. Dickens and his audience both cried when the last number of one of his two-year serials was finished. When the television series Cheers ended, it provoked an orgy of public nostalgia, as if the actual neighborhood bar of millions of people were closing.
The refusal of closure is always, at some level, a refusal to face mortality. Our fixation on electronic games and stories is in part an enactment of this denial of death. They offer us the chance to erase memory, to start over, to replay an event and try for a different resolution. In this respect, electronic media have the advantage of enacting a deeply comic vision of life, a vision of retrievable mistakes and open options. The never-ending, ever-morphing cyberspace narrative is a place to revel in a sense of endless transformations, but in order for electronic narrative to mature, it must be able to encompass tragedy as well.
Tragedy in Electronic Narrative
How do we express the irreparable losses of life with appropriate solemnity within a shape-shifting world? How can we have catharsis in a medium that resists closure? Since no hypertext story or simulation narrative in this early stage of genre development offers a satisfyingly tragic story, we can only imagine them. In my use of the word tragic, I am relying on Aristotle’s definition, as it is most commonly and somewhat loosely understood. I mean a story of a single worthy individual’s fall from a worthy life to a desperate ending through some choice or flaw of his own, a story that focuses on this irretrievable loss, arousing our feelings of pity and terror and leaving us at the end in a state of purged emotion and heightened understanding.
Let us consider the representation in electronic form of the tragic event of a young man’s suicide. I want to propose three possible suicide stories, each about the same fictional character, whom I’ll call Rob. Each story exploits the multiform nature of electronic narrative while still giving expression to the tragic heart of the story.
The Mind as Tragic Labyrinth
Suppose someone were to write an electronic portrait of Rob’s mind on the night of his suicide, like a stream-of-consciousness novel but in the form of an animated web. Each lexia, or unit of the story, would capture one haunting thought and would link to one or more others. Rob’s mind would run obsessively, from recent events (a bad performance review, a lost promotion) to past disasters (his father’s praising his younger brother for beating him at chess, his ex-girlfriend Linda’s decision to move out). Some thought patterns would lead to grandiose hopes for money and fame or to ambitions of perfection. All these chains of thought would eventually converge on the idea of killing himself. Thoughts of going for help could be represented by false links; you could click on them, but the screen would not change (they would lead nowhere). Rob might experience short flashes of remembered moments in which life was good, but these would be followed by dead-end beliefs that such moments of happiness have been lost forever or have all been invalidated by later failures or betrayals. Perhaps the navigating reader would feel impelled to return to a good memory or to trace it more deeply but would find those associations closed off, blocked by unpleasant thoughts, or too difficult to hold on to. Perhaps the accounts of good memories would fade quickly from the screen, or perhaps other, destructive, thoughts would intrude involuntarily, as represented by images or scenes that would arise by themselves without any action from the reader. All these phenomena—the obsessive rumination on failure, the doomed grandiosity, the destructive thoughts coming unbidden—would provide the reader with the opportunity to enter the consciousness of the desperate man.
By charting the thoughts of such a complex person, the writer could take as her subject matter the actual process of rumination—the repeated return to associational paths that lead to closed loops of thinking or the poignancy of a single moment of experience, a single act of perception that becomes lodged in the mind, like a roadblock on the path to hopefulness. A labyrinthine hypertext might be the ideal medium for capturing the interior monologue as a sort of snapshot of the mind itself. It could potentially offer the equivalent of Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy, not as a translation of it but as a similarly affecting universal portrait of paralysis and self-awareness. 		
How would the interior monologue reach climax and closure? The paths of the mind could change as these simulated last hours of Rob’s life progressed, so that thoughts of suicide would arise more quickly each time regardless of which paths the reader followed. Perhaps the computer would allow the process to continue only until a set number of lexias of suicidal ideation have been selected by the reader or until a certain frequency of access occurs. Suddenly, the screen darkens. The suicide occurs in “real” time. The reader would have both enacted and witnessed the decision and would feel the sense of understanding, inevitability, and sorrow that we call catharsis. 
The Web of Mourning
Another way of representing the same story might be as a three-dimensional presentation of the wake, with Rob’s devastated parents, his coworkers, his ex-girlfriends all trying to understand how such a tragedy could have happened. Each would try to explain the suicide, and by moving around the room from one mourner to another, we could follow their memories and see events from the past from their perspectives as people engaged in the inevitable but futile attempt to fix a cause for an irrational act. We would be drawn to see the whole story, since no one version would account for the event but each would add to our understanding.
					
In navigating this kaleidoscopic story, we would realize that each individual version includes elements that do not quite fit or that point us away from the teller’s version to other explanations. We would experience the loss in all of its resonance and have a sense of all the worlds of caring and trust that are torn apart by a violent death. Going through such a story would be an enactment of mourning, because the interactor’s search for an explanation would parallel the efforts of the people at the wake. Perhaps we would be given only a set number of scenes to witness at any single viewing. Then we would see the burial, with the program perhaps taking us through that final scene from the perspective of whichever mourner we had spent the most time with. Each separate viewing would provide its own experience of catharsis, but no single one would feel complete. Only after viewing all the stories, after repeating the mourning process from each of the several viewpoints, would we feel a larger catharsis: not an acceptance of Rob’s death, not an understanding of a single consistent composite explanation, but a pervasive sense of an interrelated community with multiple truths. After tracing the multiple contexts for a single act of suicide, we would be left with a tragic vision of the many Robs who had been lost.
Simulation and Destiny
These stories take the events of the story as fixed. We can trace them in multiple ways, but we cannot act within them or change the plot. Could a digital narrative offer a higher degree of agency while still preserving the sense of tragic inevitability? Can we have an interactive story that still retains what Umberto Eco calls its sense of destiny?16 One test of the limits of electronic narrative to provide agency and destiny would be to consider whether we could frame the story of Rob’s suicide in the form of a simulation.
In the simulation treatment of Rob’s suicide, the interactor would be put in the position of a god over Rob’s social world but a god with a limited power of intervention. The presentation of the world would make clear the limits of our powers, would specify what elements in Rob’s world the author is taking to be immutable. These immutable elements would be an important literary choice, for they would characterize an implicit interpretation of the “why” of Rob’s death. Would it be his neurochemistry? His family history?
A particular historical moment or political situation? A single tragic love affair? Varying the other factors would allow Rob’s life to play out in Borges’ “pullulating” time, with the fascinating diversity of possibilities that any life is open to. As deity interactor, we might guide Rob to a different job with a manager who would be more appreciative of his particular skills. Or we might send an old girlfriend to a restaurant just as Rob arrives there, to see if they could restart their relationship. Maybe we would arrange for a friend of Rob’s mother to encourage her to confront her husband about his constant put-downs of their son. One by one we could change all of the contingent conditions that seem to contribute to Rob’s self-destruction. Seeing how his life would play out in different ways would add to our sense of his vulnerability, of what little influence external factors have. We would also see how changing Rob’s life would dramatically alter the lives of the people around him. Perhaps he would have been more miserable rather than more hopeful if his old love affair had resumed. In that alternate world we might see his girlfriend blaming herself for his death, not knowing that it was inevitable. Or we might reach some ambiguous ending in which it is possible to believe that Rob will be revived in time to survive or even that he might not go through with the suicide attempt. The story would still have a sense of completion despite this variation because it would focus not on a single continuous action (as Aristotle described Greek plays) but on the whole system of subtle interrelationships that give meaning to one person’s action. This narrative system would reveal itself through its range of variation as well as through what remains constant. The tragedy of the situation would arise from a demonstration of the ways in which people unwittingly play into destructive patterns, sometimes from the best of intentions. 
Of course, the success of any of these possible tales would depend on the writer’s skill and on the particulars of storytelling that I am just crudely sketching. But there is no reason why a story like this could not be as expressive as tragic stories in any other medium. What is more, a digital narrative could capture something we have not been able to fix as clearly in linear formats: not just a tragic hero or a tragic choice but a tragic process.		
The Multipositional View
Whether we are talking about a simulation story, a rhizome hypertext, a navigable movie, or an electronic construction kit for never-ending stories, we cannot bring to a transformative, shape-shifting medium the same expectations of static shapeliness and finality that belong to linear media. But that does not mean that we will forgo a sense of completeness and emotional release. Instead, we will learn to appreciate the different kinds of closure a kaleidoscopic medium can offer.
Simulation exercises offer a good model for kaleidoscopic closure. When a live-action simulation ends, the participants hold a wrap-up session in which the god of the machine—the game master or controller of the simulation—describes what has happened and solicits experiences from all the players, who now have the opportunity to see how their individual parts fit into the overall story and to understand the many processes that make up the microworld of the simulation. For instance, in a training situation that models a foreign affairs crisis, the participants would learn what their opponents’ motives were, what other options they had been considering, and what information was known to whom at various stages of the game. In a narrative game, much of the drama of the story is not apparent until the wrap-up, when there are important plot revelations, such as who actually committed which murders, which players were long-lost secret brothers, and where the magic sword really was at 11:00 P.M. on Saturday night. At the end of the game players are able to see the whole action of the story, including their own part in it, not from the stage but from the perspective of a spectator at the top of the arena.
It is satisfying to switch positions in this way, to act in a patterned event and then later view the general pattern, like a synchronized dancer in one of the old Ziegfeld dance movies watching footage of an overhead shot of her number. But a computer simulation offers a new extension of this pleasure. On the computer we can reenter the story and experience more than one run of the same simulation. We can play all the parts, exhaust all the possible outcomes. We can construct a composite view of the narrative world that does not resolve into any single story but instead composes itself into a coherent system of interrelated actions. Because we increasingly see the world and even our own identities as such complex, centerless, open-ended systems, we need a story environment that allows us to make sense of them by enticing us into exploring a dense narrative world from every possible perspective.
One of the results of such an exploration will be a more immediate appreciation of process. Whereas novels allow us to explore character and drama allows us to explore action, simulation narrative can allow us to explore process. Because the computer is a procedural medium, it does not just describe or observe behavioral patterns, the way printed text or moving photography does; it embodies and executes them. And as a participatory medium, it allows us to collaborate in the performance. Using the computer, we can enact, modify, control, and understand processes as we never could before. We can also appreciate them aesthetically for the first time, savor the complex patterns of processes just as we savor patterns of color and shape. We do not yet have story systems that exploit this potential by describing a complex world in the procedural terms, but we are moving steadily in that direction.
The three aesthetic principles described in this section—immersion, agency, and transformation—are not so much current pleasures as they are pleasures we are anticipating as our desires are aroused by the emergence of the new medium. These pleasures are in some ways continuous with the pleasures of traditional media and in some ways unique. Certainly the combination of pleasures, like the combination of properties of the digital medium itself, is completely novel. To satisfy our desire for this new combination of pleasures, we will have to invent techniques of authorship that are similarly eclectic. The next section deals with the merger of literary and computational techniques of composition. It explores how we might go about writing for a process-centered medium and what stories and characters such procedural authorship will bring us. 
		
Chapter 6: Transformation: 2016 Update
This chapter is the most forward-looking in the book and therefore offers a wealth of underexploited design possibilities, which I hope to see more richly developed by storytellers in the coming decades. For example, I offer two models of complex storytelling that are well suited to digital formats:
• Navigating an unchanging set of events but from multiple contrasting points of view
• Replaying a real or fictional scenario with dramatically contrasting variations based on changes to circumstances or character choices
I call this approach “kaleidoscopic” to differentiate it from the “mosaic” media McLuhan talked about and the “collaged” media of the modernists. It is also different from the “deconstructed” narratives that postmodern artists and critics focus on, though it is like the postmodern opposition to imposing a single narrative upon the constructed reality of cultural experience. The postmodern sensibility enjoys subversion of the overly simplistic traditional “linear” story line in favor of the bracing confusion of indeterminate meaning; the kaleidoscopic approach emphasizes the creation of coherent multisequential narrative forms that foster more complex understanding of systems of behavior.
Like earlier media forms that are made up of paragraphs or recorded scenes, my imagined kaleidoscopic story of the future is a composite made up of fragments. But the kaleidoscopic fragments have been organized into a larger, more coherent whole, analogous to the symmetrical patterns of the kaleidoscope. However, just like kaleidoscopic configurations, the symmetrical arrangement is not fixed. There is always the possibility of rearrangement of the same elements into different patterns, of switching from one pattern to another.
Kaleidoscopic storytelling would involve the invention of new conventions of navigation and interaction that would make it easier for us to take in stories that have multiple variants. Here are a few trends in popular storytelling that encourage me to think that we are moving toward such kaleidoscopic forms.
					
Long-form television series are following multiple characters over multiple seasons. This is particularly striking in “serious” dramatic series like The Sopranos (1999–2007), The Wire (2002–08 ), Mad Men (2007–15 ), Breaking Bad (2008–13), and Justified (2010–15), which generally focus on a single larger- than-life male protagonist, but nevertheless include substantial story threads in which other members of the fictional world face significant choices and show meaningful change over time.
In particular, the Game of Thrones (2011–) TV series, based on a series of fantasy novels, has a cast of more than thirty significant characters in a single episode. The series is also shockingly prone to killing off major characters in dramatically effective ways, changing the composition of the group that is in focus. This speaks to a public that is able to keep track of a very complex storyworld and that can shift perspectives and follow multiple story arcs with strong engagement and without becoming disoriented.
Time-loop storytelling, as in Groundhog Day (1993), is an established genre with memorable non-sci-fi examples in film, such as Run Lola Run (1998), and on television, the masterful “Bowling” episode of Malcolm in the Middle (2001). The use of these complex plot structures in mass entertainment formats are evidence of a public that can transpose the expectations of video games—a repeated scenario with changed variables and alternate outcomes—to live-action storytelling.
The simulation is emerging as a form of game design that is different from branching narratives or quests and that is particularly well suited to the portrayal of complex social situations. For example, The Sims (2000–) and the experimental game Prom Week(2012).
Political games are a particularly promising arena for experimentation with kaleidoscopic storytelling.
For example, PeaceMaker(2007) allows the player to assume the role of the Palestinian president or the Israeli prime minister. By juxtaposing opposing perspectives and making events in the game reflect the complex politics of the situation, as seen by Israeli and Palestinian members of the design team, it aims at offering a replay scenario that gains in meaning with repetition.
